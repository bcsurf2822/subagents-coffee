## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates several key principles of AI-assisted development:

### 1. **Agent Specialization Works**
Each Claude Code sub-agent excelled in their domain, producing higher quality code than a generalist approach.

### 2. **Context is Critical**  
Providing comprehensive context (PRD, wireframes, API specs) enabled agents to make informed decisions and maintain consistency.

### 3. **Structured Prompts Accelerate Development**
Clear requirements, constraints, and expected outputs led to precise implementations with minimal iteration.

### 4. **Integration Planning Prevents Issues**
Defining interfaces upfront (API contracts, data models) enabled parallel development without integration problems.

### 5. **Testing Validates AI Output**
Automated end-to-end tests provided confidence that AI-generated code works correctly in real scenarios.
