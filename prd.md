# Product Requirements Document: Coffee Shop Online Store

## 1. Product Overview

A modern, full-stack e-commerce web application for browsing and purchasing coffee products. The application provides a seamless shopping experience with a clean, responsive interface for customers to explore different coffee varieties, add items to their cart, and complete purchases through a streamlined checkout process.

## 2. Goals

- **User Goal**: To easily browse, select, and purchase high-quality coffee products online with a delightful shopping experience.
- **Business Goal**: To create a scalable online sales platform that showcases our coffee selection, increases sales conversion, and provides valuable customer insights.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### Frontend (High Priority)

- **FR1.1**: Display coffee products in a responsive grid layout with filtering options by type (beans, ground, pods).
- **FR1.2**: Each product shall be represented as a "Product Card" component.
- **FR1.3**: The Product Card must display product name, image, price, roast level, and origin.
- **FR1.4**: Implement a shopping cart that persists across sessions.
- **FR1.5**: Provide a product detail page with expanded information and "Add to Cart" functionality.
- **FR1.6**: Create a checkout flow with order summary and payment form.

### Backend (High Priority)

- **FR2.1**: Provide RESTful API endpoints for product management:
  - `GET /api/products` - List all products with pagination
  - `GET /api/products/:id` - Get single product details
  - `GET /api/categories` - List product categories
- **FR2.2**: Shopping cart endpoints:
  - `POST /api/cart` - Add item to cart
  - `GET /api/cart` - Get current cart
  - `PUT /api/cart/:itemId` - Update quantity
  - `DELETE /api/cart/:itemId` - Remove item
- **FR2.3**: Order processing:
  - `POST /api/orders` - Create new order
  - `GET /api/orders/:id` - Get order details
- **FR2.4**: Implement session management for cart persistence.

## 4. Explicit Non-Goals (MVP Scope)

To ensure a focused initial release, the following are out of scope:

- **NO User Accounts**: Initial version will use guest checkout only.
- **NO Real Payment Processing**: Use mock payment confirmation.
- **NO Inventory Management**: Assume unlimited stock.
- **NO Admin Interface**: Product data will be seeded directly.
- **NO Email Notifications**: Order confirmation displayed on-screen only.
- **NO Reviews/Ratings**: Focus on core shopping functionality.

## 5. User Experience

- Modern, coffee-shop aesthetic with warm colors and professional typography.
- Mobile-first responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices.
- Intuitive navigation with clear visual hierarchy.
- Fast page loads and smooth transitions between states.
- Clear feedback for all user actions (adding to cart, errors, success states).

## 6. Technical Considerations

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI for high-performance API.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for product and order data.
- **State Management**: React Context for cart state, React Query for server state.
- **Data Models**:
  - **Product**: `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `category`, `roast_level`, `origin`, `image_url`, `in_stock`
  - **CartItem**: `product_id`, `quantity`, `session_id`
  - **Order**: `id`, `items`, `total`, `status`, `created_at`, `customer_info`
